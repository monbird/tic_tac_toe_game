                    <p>Tic Tac Toe is an old paper and pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the
                        spaces in a 3x3 grid.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each player takes a turn placing his character (X or O) into one of the nine squares</li>
                        <li>A player cannot place his symbol in a square that is already occupied by a symbol</li>
                        <li>The game ends when a player creates a winning combination of his symbols or when there are no empty squares remaining</li>
                        <li>The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or
                            diagonal row is the winner </li>
                        <li>When the board fills up with neither player winning, the game ends in a draw</li>
                        <li>It is up to the players who starts first and which mark they have</li>
